For automation testers, identifying elements and performing actions is an important task. To make it easier, the concept called Locators was introduced in Selenium. But manually locating elements is a time-consuming task due to the complexity of the DOM structure of a webpage. This is where ChroPath comes into the picture and eases the task of locating elements in Selenium. In this article we will talk about chropath and its features.

What is ChroPath?

ChroPath is a development tool to edit, inspect and generate XPath and CSS selectors. ChroPath makes it easy to write, edit, extract, and evaluate XPath and CSS queries on any webpage and saves atleast 40â€“50% manual effort in automation script writing.
