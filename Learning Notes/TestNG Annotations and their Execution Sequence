What is TestNG Annotation?
TestNG Annotation is a piece of code which is inserted inside a program or business logic used to control the flow of execution of test methods.

List of TestNG Annotations
 Below are the different annotations used in TestNG

@BeforeSuite: The annotated method will be run only once before all tests in this suite have run.

@AfterSuite: The annotated method will be run only once after all tests in this suite have run.

@BeforeTest: The annotated method will be run before any test method belonging to the classes inside the <test> tag is run.

@AfterTest: The annotated method will be run after all the test methods belonging to the classes inside the <test> tag have run.

@BeforeClass: The annotated method will be run only once before the first test method in the current class is invoked.

@AfterClass: The annotated method will be run only once after all the test methods in the current class have run.

@BeforeMethod: The annotated method will be run before each test method.

@AfterMethod: The annotated method will be run after each test method.

@BeforeGroups - The @BeforeGroups annotated method run only once for a group before the execution of all test cases belonging to that group.

@AfterGroups - The @AfterGroups annotated method run only once for a group after the execution of all test cases belonging to that group.

Benefits of using TestNG Annotations:
TestNG Annotations made the life of testers very easy. Based on your requirements, you can access the test methods, i.e., it has no predefined pattern or format.
You can pass the additional parameters to TestNG annotations.
In the case of TestNG annotations, you do not need to extend any test classes.
TestNG Annotations are strongly typed, i.e., errors are detected at the compile time.
