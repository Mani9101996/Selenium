ShadowDOM Support
It was never possible to verify and write the cssSelectors for shadowDOM elements but this amazing innovation made it possible.
 


 

Proper error message for missing elements in selectors
Earlier there was nothing which can tell us what’s wrong in our selector. We were never able to understand what’s wrong in our selector until we are not expert in it. Devtools suggests 0 matching node for wrong selector pattern. But now we have the Selector’s guide which helps us with the correct error message and what is wrong or missing in our selector.
 


Iframe support
It supports iframes as well. It will let you know if the inspected element is inside an iframe or not. Now we can easily write and verify selectors for elements inside an iframe without wasting any time.
 

SVG element support
Many of us are not aware that svg elements don't support the standard xpath format. SVG elements support different xpath patterns. SelectorsHub has made it easy and let you know the correct format and helps you to learn how to write selectors for svg elements.
