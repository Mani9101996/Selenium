There are different ways to import data into Excel using Selenium Java. One of the most popular libraries for this task is Apache POI, which provides classes and methods to read and write data from various formats of Excel files, such as XLS and XLSX¹².

To use Apache POI, you need to download the jar files from [here](^6^) and add them to your project classpath. Then, you can use the following classes and interfaces to manipulate Excel files:

- Workbook: Represents a Microsoft Excel file. It can be used for creating and maintaining the spreadsheet. A workbook may contain many sheets.
- Sheet: Represents a page in a Microsoft Excel file that contains the number of rows and columns.
- Row: Represents a collection of cells, which is used to represent a row in the spreadsheet.
- Cell: Represents a single cell in a row. Data entered by a user is stored in a cell. Data can be of the type such as string, numeric value, or formula.

To read data from an Excel file, you need to create a FileInputStream object and pass the file path as a parameter. Then, you need to create a Workbook object using the WorkbookFactory class and pass the FileInputStream object as a parameter. Next, you need to get the Sheet object using the getSheet method and pass the sheet name or index as a parameter. After that, you need to get the Row object using the getRow method and pass the row number as a parameter. Finally, you need to get the Cell object using the getCell method and pass the column number as a parameter. You can then use the getStringCellValue, getNumericCellValue, or getBooleanCellValue methods to get the data from the cell.

To write data to an Excel file, you need to create a FileOutputStream object and pass the file path as a parameter. Then, you need to create a Workbook object using the XSSFWorkbook or HSSFWorkbook class, depending on the file format. Next, you need to create a Sheet object using the createSheet method and pass the sheet name as a parameter. After that, you need to create a Row object using the createRow method and pass the row number as a parameter. Finally, you need to create a Cell object using the createCell method and pass the column number as a parameter. You can then use the setCellValue method to set the data to the cell. You also need to call the write method on the Workbook object and pass the FileOutputStream object as a parameter. You also need to close the FileOutputStream object after writing the data.

Here is an example of how to read and write data from an Excel file using Apache POI:

```java
//Import statements
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import org.apache.poi.ss.usermodel.Sheet;
import org.apache.poi.ss.usermodel.Workbook;
import org.apache.poi.ss.usermodel.WorkbookFactory;
import org.apache.poi.xssf.usermodel.XSSFWorkbook;

//Read data from Excel file
File file = new File("C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\TestData.xlsx"); //Create an object of File class to open xlsx file
FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream(file); //Create an object of FileInputStream class to read excel file
Workbook workbook = WorkbookFactory.create(inputStream); //Create Workbook instance holding reference to .xlsx file
Sheet sheet = workbook.getSheet("Sheet1"); //Get first sheet from the workbook
Row row = sheet.getRow(0); //Get first row from the sheet
Cell cell = row.getCell(0); //Get first cell from the row
String data = cell.getStringCellValue(); //Get the data from the cell
System.out.println("Data from the Excel file: " + data); //Print the data

//Write data to Excel file
FileOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream(file); //Create an object of FileOutputStream class to write data in excel file

Workbook newWorkbook = new XSSFWorkbook(); //Create an object of XSSFWorkbook class
Sheet newSheet = newWorkbook.createSheet("Sheet2"); //Create a sheet in the workbook
Row newRow = newSheet.createRow(0); //Create a row in the sheet
Cell newCell = newRow.createCell(0); //Create a cell in the row
newCell.setCellValue("Hello world"); //Set the data to the cell
newWorkbook.write(outputStream); //Write data in the excel file
outputStream.close(); //Close output stream
```
